# About
With the advancement of technology and the internet, network assaults take many different forms. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are one of the most difficult security risks that the internet now faces. Attacks known as distributed denial of service (DDoS) are particularly worrisome since they can seriously impair a victim's computer or communication capabilities with little to no prior notice. Due to their complexity and frequency, these attacks are challenging to recognize and defend against. Wireshark can be used to find a spike in traffic during a DDoS assault.
